# What you need here is to resolve these hosts. At least initially, it's
# probably going to be easiest to put these into /etc/hosts on the control
# node. If you have a DNS you can use, even better. Or, if you want to, add
# ansible_host variable to each of those.
#
# OCP4 nodes by operating system
#
# RHCOS nodes:
[ocp_coreos]
bootstrap.ocp.lab.example.com
master.ocp.lab.example.com
worker1.ocp.lab.example.com
worker2.ocp.lab.example.com

# RHEL8 node:
[ocp_rhel]
services.lab.example.com

# These groups exist because of the ability to share the same process of
# subscribing the physical and virtual machines to RHSM, activating
# subscriptions and repositories, and updating packages.
#
# Because the only RHEL VM is actually the services VM, all RHEL stuff could
# actually be moved to just the ocp_rhel group, but the breakdown is kept
# around because of the additional hypervisor setup option.
#
# Have a look at corresponding group_vars files to configure subscriptions, but
# basically the trick is this:
#   - rhel is the top level group: use it for RHSM credentials at least
#   - if you use the same subscription for all VMs, set the pools there as well
#   - otherwise, set the subscription pools on a per-group basis
#   - in any case, set up which repositories to enable on a per-version basis
#
# The important bit is that the rhel8 group contains the ocp_rhel group.

# These are the target systems to deploy the cluster to.
#
# NOTE: the way the playbooks are written right now, by placing more than one
# host into this group, you will actually get several identical deployments on
# each of those. A funny side effect, but one worth considering.
#
# UNSUPPORTED: Put your hypervisor systems here if you want to manage them with
# playbooks. There is a full libvirt configuration procedure there, but it
# unfortunately expects the system to be dedicated and freshly installed from
# scratch.
