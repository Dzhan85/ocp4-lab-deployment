# These groups exist because of the ability to share the same process of
# subscribing the physical and virtual machines to RHSM, activating
# subscriptions and repositories, and updating packages.
#
# Because the only RHEL VM is actually the services VM, all RHEL stuff could
# actually be moved to just the ocp_rhel group, but the breakdown is kept
# around because of the additional hypervisor setup option.
#
# Have a look at corresponding group_vars files to configure subscriptions, but
# basically the trick is this:
#   - rhel is the top level group: use it for RHSM credentials at least
#   - if you use the same subscription for all VMs, set the pools there as well
#   - otherwise, set the subscription pools on a per-group basis
#   - in any case, set up which repositories to enable on a per-version basis
#
# The important bit is that the rhel8 group contains the ocp_rhel group.
