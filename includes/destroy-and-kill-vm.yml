# This basically just powers off and undefines a VM if it's found in the list
# of VMs on the host.
#
# It depends on the var called current_vm_name which should be set by the
# master play to do other things anyway, so no woes here.
#
# The method of shutting down the VM can be switched to a less brutal one by
# setting kill_method=shutdown in the including task in the parent.
